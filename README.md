# SevaSetu AI

SevaSetu AI is an AI-powered, multilingual, voice-first platform designed to help Indian citizens discover, understand, and access government welfare schemes and public services.

The solution focuses on improving access for rural, elderly, and underserved communities by addressing language barriers, low digital literacy, and lack of awareness.


## Problem Statement

Millions of Indian citizens are unable to access government schemes and public services due to:
- Complex and fragmented information
- English-only digital platforms

## Proposed Solution

SevaSetu AI provides a conversational AI interface that allows citizens to:
- Interact using voice or text
- Communicate in their preferred Indian language
- Discover relevant government schemes
- Check eligibility through simple questions
- Receive step-by-step application guidance

The platform is designed with accessibility, inclusivity, and ethical AI principles.
